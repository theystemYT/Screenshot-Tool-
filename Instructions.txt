   - Install the required library using:  
     ```

3. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   - **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.  
   - **Mac/Linux:** Open the Terminal.

4. **Navigate to the Scriptâ€™s Directory**  
   - Use `cd` to go to the folder where `screenshot_tool.py` is located.  
     ```
     cd C:\path\to\your\script   # Windows  
     cd /path/to/your/script     # Mac/Linux
     ```

5. **Run the Script**

   - When prompted, enter the directory where screenshots should be saved. Example:

     or  
     ```
     Enter the directory to save screenshots: /home/yourname/Pictures
     ```

7. **Screenshot is Saved**  
   - The script will take a screenshot and save it with a timestamped filename.  
   - Example output:  
     ```
     Screenshot saved: C:\Users\YourName\Pictures\screenshot_2025-02-15_12-30-00.png

- Run the script whenever you want to take a quick screenshot.
- Modify the script to set a default save location if needed.
